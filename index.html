  INTRODUCTION

  Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
  the pitch.
-->
<p>The <a href="http://platforms.monash.edu/bioinformatics/" target="_blank">Monash Bioinformatics Platform</a> want to help make introductory bioinformatic approaches part of the research landscape in Biomedicine. To do this, a foundation level of expertise amongst as many researchers as possible is an important step forward. The Python programming language is versatile and popular in the bioinformatics community.</p>

<p>This workshop aims to equip participants with the fundamentals of programming and give them the skills needed to take bioinformatic approaches to research questions.
</p>
<p>
 <p>
  The workshop will be taught in a similar style to Software Carpentry workshops. <a href="{{site.swc_site}}">Software Carpentry</a>'s mission
   is to help scientists and engineers get more research done in less
   time and with less pain by teaching them basic lab skills for
   scientific computing.
</p>

  where 'YYYY-MM-DD-site' is the identifier for your workshop (e.g.,
  '2015-06-10-esu'.

  SYLLABUS

  Show what topics will be covered.

  1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
     around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
  2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
  3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
     intend to teach.
  4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
     the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

  This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
  please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
  'tools/check' as well.
